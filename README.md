# ðŸš€ AI Search Algorithms Workshop  

Welcome to the **AI Search Algorithms Workshop**! This session covers fundamental search techniques used in Artificial Intelligence, including both uninformed and informed search strategies.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered  

### ðŸ”¹ Uninformed Search Algorithms  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** â€“ Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper.  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** â€“ Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.  

### ðŸ”¹ Informed Search Algorithms  
- **Greedy Best-First Search** â€“ Uses a heuristic to prioritize the most promising paths.  
- **A* Algorithm** â€“ Combines path cost and heuristics for optimal searching.  

### ðŸ”¹ Game Search Techniques  
- **Minimax Algorithm** â€“ Decision-making in adversarial games.  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning** â€“ Optimization for Minimax to eliminate unnecessary calculations.
